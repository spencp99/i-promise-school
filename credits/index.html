      <p> This website is meant to showcase the charitable work NBA Superstar LeBron James has done in his hometown of Akron during his career. It focuses on his groundbreaking I PROMISE School, meant to help the cities underprivledged youth. On this website, you can learn more about the foundations history and its previous work, get information on the I PROMISE program, and listen to LeBrons speech from the schools opening</p> 
      <p>I wanted to make this site because I believe LeBron gets too much flak from the media, especially those on the more conservative side who see brining politics into sports as a negative. In reality his work has done immesaurable good for the city of Akron and deserves to be praised. </p>
