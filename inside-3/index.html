                <h2>A Thank You To His City</h2>
                <h3 class="speech">Growing up in Akron, wasn't always easy for LeBron James. He thanks his friends and the people surrounding him for always keeping him on the right path growing up. James hopes the I PROMISE School can do the same and more for Akrons youth. In his speech at the 2018 opening ceremony for the school, James shares his reasoning for building the school and how he hopes it will help others succeed like he had. </h3>
